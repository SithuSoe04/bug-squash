## ðŸ§© Goal

Your mission is to make **all tests pass** âœ… by identifying and fixing bugs in:

| File | Theme | Example Bug |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `models.py` | Data modeling | Mutable defaults, incorrect refund logic |
| `utils.py` | Helpers | Floating-point rounding, missing import |
| `payments.py` | Business logic | Missing balance checks, wrong state |
| `api.py` | Integration | Wrong key names, bad customer lookups |
| `main.py` | CLI integration | Incorrect payloads |
